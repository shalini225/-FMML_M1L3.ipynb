        "1. Why does the TF-IDF approach generally result in a better accuracy than Bag-of-Words ?\n",
        "A) The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) approach generally results in better accuracy compared to the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model because it incorporates more meaningful information about the importance of words within a dataset. Here’s a breakdown of why TF-IDF performs better:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Weighting of Terms Based on Importance\n",
        "\n",
        "Bag-of-Words: Treats all words equally. It only counts the raw frequency of words in a document, which means frequent words (like \"the,\" \"is,\" or \"and\") tend to dominate the representation, even though they carry little meaningful information.\n",
        "\n",
        "TF-IDF: Assigns weights to words based on their importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Term Frequency (TF): Captures how frequently a word appears in a document.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Reduces the weight of common words that appear in many documents, emphasizing less frequent but more discriminative words.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, TF-IDF downplays the significance of common stopwords and emphasizes unique terms that can better distinguish between documents.\n",

        "2. Reduction of Noise\n",
        "\n",
        "In BoW, frequent but unimportant words (e.g., stopwords) can introduce noise into the model, leading to poorer performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "TF-IDF reduces the influence of such noise by assigning low weights to words that appear in almost all documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Improved Discrimination Between Documents\n",
        "\n",
        "Words with high IDF scores are typically rare and specific to certain documents, making them more useful for distinguishing between classes or topics.\n",

        "\n",

        "While BoW treats all words equally, TF-IDF accounts for the relative importance of words in a document and across the corpus.
